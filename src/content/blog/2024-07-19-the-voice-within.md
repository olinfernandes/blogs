The anger, the frustration, the hate, the guilt,
Building up inside me is a pile of filth.
All I see in the mirror is an enemy,
Full of rage, staring back at me,
holding me back from what I could be,
limiting my options to the norms of society.

_**The Voice**_:
You keep messing up, you are not good enough,
You're too weak & simply not strong enough.
Simply do what you're told without questions.
Elders have lived their lives and you need to learn their lessons.

_**Me**_:
I make mistakes to learn from them,
I ask questions so I can understand them,
My thoughts are my own, don't make me deny them.

_**The Voice**_:
You're a nobody with nothing to your name,
Bury your pride and fall in line,
You've got a long life ahead and it's not going to easy.
Do as you're told and you just might be lucky enough to be happy.

```markdown
Rise above this anger, rise above this hate,
Write your own story, direct your fate,
Change your props and let the state update.
You got one life, so why not make it great?
```

_**Me**_:
The games have changed since the old time,
Things are not they way they appear in your mind.
Broaden your vision and absorb the bigger picture,
Things aren't black and white,
Rather, a thick & complex mixture.

_**The Voice**_ :
Life is simple if you do as you're told.
The complexity creeps in when you try to do it on your own.
Finish your studies then start working,
Build your career & find someone worth marrying.
Have a few kids and keep on providing.
Accept this reality of struggling.

_**Me**_:
I object on so many levels.
Why does life have to be full of struggles?
Why do we compete to see who is better?
Why can't we realize that we're all in this together?
Why is a person's worth tied to how much they earn?
Why don't we realize we have so much to learn?

```markdown
Rise above this anger, rise above this hate,
Write your own story, direct your fate,
Change your props and let the state update.
You got one life, so why not make it great?
```

_**The Voice**_:
Nobody cares so why should you?
Take care of yourself cause nobody else is going to.
What's important is how society sees you.
Bolster your reputation & temper your ego.
Don't get distracted by the suffering around you.
Their life means nothing to you.

_**Me**_:
I see you've calmed down, so I'll follow suit.
Now pay head to this undeniable truth.
The Tree of Life overflows from tip to root.
Abundance of air, water, and life itself.
Be aware of what is hidden in stealth.
In today's world, the threat is rarely in sight.
There are two ways to thrive,
Be a nomad or be within a tribe.

_**The Voice**_:
What you say is true.
If we don't like where we are,
Then we merely pack up and move.
The problem, though, is that it's not so easy to move.
There are costs, paperwork, and other formalities.
By the time you've navigated the bureaucracies,
You'd wish you never wasted the time or energy.
You don't need to "discover". You are defined by your family.

_**Me**_:
I see your point and here's my rebuke.
Go for a walk and keep it subtle.
No cost, paperwork, or other formalities.
You and nature in perfect harmony.
I am defined by the family that comes from me.
You're right, I need to work on me.
Not for following the blueprint blindly,
rather for securing the family that comes from me.
