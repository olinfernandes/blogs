HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language and is the backbone of web development [^1]. It is used to construct the structure and content of web pages. In this post, we'll go over the basics of HTML to help you get started with web programming.

## _What is HTML?_
The markup language HTML consists of items denoted by tags (<>). These tags specify the meaning of the material that wraps around headings, paragraphs, pictures, and links.

## _Basic HTML Structure_

A basic HTML document consists of:

- `<html>`: The root element
- `<head>`: Contains metadata (title, charset, etc.)
- `<body>`: The content of the web page

## _Essential HTML Elements_

| Type       | Syntax                 |
| :--------- | :--------------------- |
| Headings   | `<h1-6>`               |
| Paragraphs | `<p>`                  |
| Images     | `<img>`                |
| Links      | `<a>`                  |
| Lists      | `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>` |

## _Example: Basic HTML Page_

```bash
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ website
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ image.jpeg
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html
```

Here's an example of a simple HTML page with common tags:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>My First HTML Page</title>
</head>
<body>
	<h1>Welcome to My Page</h1>
	<p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
	<img src="image.jpeg" alt="An image on my page">
	<a href="https://www.google.com/">Visit Google</a>
  <br>
	<ul>
		<li>Item 1</li>
		<li>Item 2</li>
		<li>Item 3</li>
	</ul>
</body>
</html>
```
